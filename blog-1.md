The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript.

Typescript is a modern solution of checking the type of variables in right time. Union and Intersection types are the one of the most prominent types of TS. These types allow developers to write flexible, readable, and type-safe code by providing fine control over how types can be combined or separated. By understanding and using Union and Intersection types effectively, we can make our TypeScript code more understandable.

Union Types: Allowing Multiple Possible Types

    Union types enable a variable to hold one of several types. It is similar to saying, “this value can be either type A or type B.” This feature is especially useful when we are dealing with data that could come in various forms, such as input fields that might receive either a number or a string, or responses from APIs that might return either data or an error message.

    Symbol:

    (|) this symbol is used to separate types by union. It acts like or of JS. 
    For Example: let input = number | boolean

    here it's compulsory to provide input either number of boolean type.


    Use of Union Types:

    Union types improve flexibility and type safety, particularly when handling data that can be more than one type. This is often necessary in real-world applications, where data isn’t always in a consistent format. Union types:

    1.  Allow us to handle multiple types in a controlled way,
    2.  Enhance code readability by making type intentions clear,
    3.  Provide type safety without restricting flexibility.

Intersection Types: Combining Multiple Types Together

     Intersection types allow us to combine multiple types into one, meaning that an object must meet the requirements of all included types. It is similar to saying, “this value must satisfy both type A and type B.” Intersection types are helpful when we want to combine types from multiple sources or create a new type by merging two existing types.
    
    Symbol:
    (&) is used to combine two types. It acts as and of JS.

    For example: 
    
    type Person = { name: string };
    type Contact = { email: string };
    type Employee = Person & Contact;

    here, Employee must have both a name and an email.

    Use of Intersection:
    
    Intersection types are ideal for scenarios where a single object or variable needs to have the characteristics of multiple types. They:

    1.  Allow type composition, making it easy to combine smaller types into larger ones,
    2.  Ensure that a single variable meets the requirements of multiple types,
    3.  Are especially useful in complex applications, where objects often need properties from several types.
   

    Example code of both types:

    type Dog = { bark: () => void };
    type Cat = { meow: () => void };

    // Union type: Animal can be either Dog or Cat
    type AnimalUnion = Dog | Cat;

    // Intersection type: Pet must have both Dog and Cat properties
    type PetIntersection = Dog & Cat;

    const petUnion: AnimalUnion = { bark: () => console.log("Woof") }; // Valid
    // petUnion could also be { meow: () => console.log("Meow") }, which is also valid.

    const petIntersection: PetIntersection = {
        bark: () => console.log("Woof"),
        meow: () => console.log("Meow")
    }; // Valid, but requires both bark and meow methods.


hence, Both Union and Intersection types enhance TypeScript’s type system by making code more expressive, readable, and type-safe, ensuring that data structures meet specific requirements while maintaining flexibility. Understanding how and when to use each can help developers write cleaner and more reliable TypeScript code.
